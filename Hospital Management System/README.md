# Hospital Management System

This Hospital Management System helps track and organize all of its patients and staff. Patients are separated in two categories: InPatients whose care requires them to have a prolonged stay at the hospital, and Outpatients who have a fixed appointment with one of the doctors. Oupatients are charged a fixed fee of 45$ per visit while Inpatients incur a daily rate of 100$ for the length of their stay. This system keeps track of the available hospital beds using unique Ids and determines whether an Inpatient can be administered or not. It also keeps track of doctors using their license number, name and specialty. Finally, patients are organized by name, assigned bed (only for Inpatients),appointment date (or Admission & Discharge dates), doctors and hospital charge, all of which can be easily accessed by staff using the command prompt interface.
